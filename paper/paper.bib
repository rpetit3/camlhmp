              pneumococcal infections. The spread of β-lactam-resistant
              pneumococci is a major concern in choosing an effective therapy
              for patients. Systematically tracking β-lactam resistance could
              benefit disease surveillance. Here we developed a classification
              system in which a pneumococcal isolate is assigned to a ``PBP
              type'' based on sequence signatures in the transpeptidase domains
              (TPDs) of the three critical penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs),
              PBP1a, PBP2b, and PBP2x. We identified 307 unique PBP types from
              2,528 invasive pneumococcal isolates, which had known MICs to six
              β-lactams based on broth microdilution. We found that increased
              β-lactam MICs strongly correlated with PBP types containing
              divergent TPD sequences. The PBP type explained 94 to 99\% of
              variation in MICs both before and after accounting for genomic
              backgrounds defined by multilocus sequence typing, indicating that
              genomic backgrounds made little independent contribution to
              β-lactam MICs at the population level. We further developed and
              evaluated predictive models of MICs based on PBP type. Compared to
              microdilution MICs, MICs predicted by PBP type showed essential
              agreement (MICs agree within 1 dilution) of >98\%, category
              agreement (interpretive results agree) of >94\%, a major
              discrepancy (sensitive isolate predicted as resistant) rate of
              <3\%, and a very major discrepancy (resistant isolate predicted as
              sensitive) rate of <2\% for all six β-lactams. Thus, the PBP
              transpeptidase signatures are robust indicators of MICs to
              different β-lactam antibiotics in clinical pneumococcal isolates
              and serve as an accurate alternative to phenotypic susceptibility
              testing. IMPORTANCE: The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae
              is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. β-Lactam
              antibiotics such as penicillin and ceftriaxone are the drugs of
              choice to treat pneumococcal infections. Some pneumococcal strains
              have developed β-lactam resistance through altering their
              penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and have become a major concern
              in choosing effective patient therapy. To systematically track and
              predict β-lactam resistance, we obtained the sequence signatures
              of PBPs from a large collection of clinical pneumococcal isolates
              using whole-genome sequencing data and found that these ``PBP
              types'' were predictive of resistance levels. Our findings can
              benefit the current era of strain surveillance when whole-genome
              sequencing data often lacks detailed resistance information. Using
              PBP positions that we found are always substituted within highly
              resistant strains may lead to further refinements. Sequence-based
              predictions are accurate and may lead to the ability to extract
              critical resistance information from nonculturable clinical
              specimens.",

              (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics,
              the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very
              long queries or database sequences. There are also some
              shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line
              applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of
              rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line
              applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for
              processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run
              times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve
              only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and
              memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of
              contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking
              information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new
              modular software library can now access subject sequence data from
              arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features,
              including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their
              favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and
              downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST
              command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools,
              demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as
              well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also

              sets and outputs the processed data to a structured directory
              format, and a series of Bactopia Tools (BaTs) that perform
              specific postprocessing on some or all of the processed data. BaTs

              sequence file formats and multiple sequence alignments, dealing
              with 3D macro molecular structures, interacting with common tools
              such as BLAST, ClustalW and EMBOSS, accessing key online
              databases, as well as providing numerical methods for statistical
              learning. AVAILABILITY: Biopython is freely available, with

               established in the 2000s and has been employed as a tool for the
               molecular epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
               aureus, as well as the evolution investigation of Staphylococcus
               species. Molecular cloning and the conventional sequencing of
               SCCmec have been adopted to verify the presence and structure of
               a novel SCCmec type, while convenient PCR-based SCCmec
               identification methods have been used in practical settings for
               many years. In addition, whole-genome sequencing has been widely
               used, and various SCCmec and similar structures have been
               recently identified in various species. The current status of the
               SCCmec types, SCCmec subtypes, rules for nomenclature, and
               multiple methods for identifying SCCmec types and subtypes were
               summarized in this review, according to the perspective of the
               International Working Group on the Classification of

  abstract = "AbstractThe bacterial sequence data publicly available at the
              global DNA archives is a vast source of information on the
              evolution of bacteria and their mobile elements. However, most of
              it is either unassembled or inconsistently assembled and QC-ed.
              This makes it unsuitable for large-scale analyses, and
              inaccessible for most researchers to use. In 2021 Blackwell et al
              therefore released a uniformly assembled set of 661,405 genomes,
              consisting of all publicly available whole genome sequenced
              bacterial isolate data as of November 2018, along with various
              search indexes. In this study we extend that dataset up to August
              2024, more than tripling the number of genomes. We also expand the
              scope, as we begin a global collaborative project to generate
              annotations for different species as desired by different research
              communities.In this study we describe the project as of release
              2024-08, comprising 2,440,377 assemblies (including the 661k
              dataset). All 2.4 million have been uniformly reprocessed for
              quality criteria and to give taxonomic abundance estimates with
              respect to the GTDB phylogeny. We also provide antimicrobial
              resistance (AMR) gene and mutation annotation via AMRFinderPlus.
              Using an evolution-informed compression approach, the full set of
              genomes is just 130Gb in batched xz archives. We also provide
              multiple search indexes and a method for alignment to the full
              dataset. Finally, we outline plans for future annotations to be
              provided in further releases.",
